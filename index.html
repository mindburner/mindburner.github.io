			<h2>What is Mindburner?</h2>
			<p>
				Mindburner is an iPhone app that leverages your visual memory to keep your sensitive information like passwords secure. Remembering passwords is hard, but selecting images that you’ve seen before from ones that you haven’t is easy. Mindburner translates the images you selected into characters. The key is that every selection of images translates into some information, but only you know which selection translates into <em>your</em> information.
			</p>

			<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Create a new item by typing in the name, and the information you want to remember, such as a credit card number or internet account password. From here on, we assume you entered a password.
				</li>
				<li>
					Mindburner will show you a series of <em>target</em> images. Learn these images by following the prompts. The password you entered earlier is tied to these images, so learn them carefully.
				</li>
				<li>
					Now all you have to do is remember your images. When you return to the app later, you can select your target images to reveal your passwords. Once this is done, all the items you stored earlier will be revealed.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The value of each item in the list is determined by the images you select. Selecting the images you learned will reveal the correct values. Selecting the wrong images will just reveal different values.
			</p>

			<h2>How many images do I have to remember?</h2>
			<p>
				It depends on the length of your longest password. The upper bound is two images per character. That means a robust password of 15 characters would require you to learn 30 images.
			</p>

			<h2>I can’t remember 30 images!</h2>
			<p>
				Yes, you can. In fact, there are decades of academic research (including our own) that say you can easily recall hundreds of images, even without seeing them for a month.
			</p>

			<h2>What if I forget my images anyway?</h2>
			<p>
				Forgetting your images is extremely unlikely, but it is possible if you don’t use the app for a very long period of time. Unfortunately, there is currently no process for recovering them. We recommend refreshing your memory at least twice a week to prevent this from happening. Our tag-based image training process is designed so that if you do forget an image, remembering the tags associated with that image should be enough to remind you.
			</p>
			<p>
				In future versions, Mindburner will also be able to correct some errors. With error correction, the correct passwords will still be revealed as long as you only forget one or two images.
			</p>

			<h2>Why are my existing passwords incorrect?</h2>
			<p>
				You selected the wrong images. See above if you forgot what your target images are.
			</p>

			<h2>Why is my new password too long?</h2>
			<p>
				There aren’t enough images to represent your password. We are continuously adding new images, so there should be enough for your password soon.
			</p>

			<h2>Where do these images come from?</h2>
			<p>
				We hand curated a set of 200 memorable images from the public domain. We will keep adding new images over time. At the moment, you can’t choose which images are yours or use your own images, but we are considering these features for future versions.
			</p>

			<h2>Does Mindburner write my passwords down?</h2>
			<p>
				No. Mindburner only stores the image set and the image-to-character maps that generate each value in your list of passwords. The image set does not include any information about which images were assigned to you. The maps determine how each selection of images translates into characters, but they do not reveal anything about which selections yield the “correct” passwords.
			</p>

			<h2>Can someone get my passwords if they have my phone?</h2>
			<p>
				No. Even if someone has your device, they would have to correctly select all your images to reveal your passwords. Selecting your images without knowing them ahead of time is equivalent to simply guessing what your password is.
			</p>

			<h2>Can’t they just hack it?</h2>
			<p>
				No. Your passwords aren’t written down at all; they’re in your memory, encoded as images. A hacker would have to ask you for the images personally to get them.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, if an attacker steals your phone it is possible to determine whether two passwords are the same. This is an issue in the current beta version that we are already taking steps to resolve.
			</p>

			<h2>Why isn’t ______ working?</h2>
			<p>
				That depends. Tell us about it by sending an email to <a href="mailto:feedback@mindburner.com">feedback@mindburner.io</a>. The app is still in its early stages, so we need your help to figure out what is working, what isn’t, and how it can be improved.
